"This project, 0x09 Python - Everything is an Object, is a little bit different than the usual projects. The first part consists of questions about Python’s specificity, such as “What would be the result of…”. As is customary, you should read all documentation first. Take the time to think and brainstorm with your peers about what you think and why. Try to do this without coding anything for a few hours."
